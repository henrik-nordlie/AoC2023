Note to self:

Task 2 has a bug. It had a problem when detecting the same number twice if two of the digits of that number are ajacent to the "*"
This happens in the bottom left of the test data. I fixed this by checking if the second number is different from the previous,
but this would break if the second number coincidentally was the same as the fist. Then it would only find one neighbour to the "*"
